# The .Net Spotify API

This project implements all of the base functionalities of the Spotify API, mostly using different HTTP requests. 
It contains a class for authentication, and a class for each separate functionality, including but not limited to playing songs, creating playlists, linking and unliking songs, creating queues and podcast support.

This API is ready to be imported into your .Net application, however, you may need to update some method as they may have become deprecated. 
In order to be able to generate a token for yourself, you will need to create an app on the developer page (https://developer.spotify.com/). Please note that some of the functionalities are only available if you have a premium account.

I hope you find this library helpful in your own projects!
